Since its early developments, Atom Probe Tomography has contributed to major advances in materials science.

The sample is prepared in the form of a very sharp tip. The cooled tip is biased at high DC voltage (3-15 kV). The very small radius of the tip and the High Voltage induce a very high electrostatic field (tens V/nm) at the tip surface, just below the point of atom evaporation. Under laser or HV pulsing, one or more atoms are evaporated from the surface, by field effect (near 100% ionization), and projected onto a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) with a very high detection efficiency. Ion efficiencies are as high as 80%, the highest analytical efficiency of any 3D microscopy."""@en .

1. establishes a relation between the values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties and
2. uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication
NOTE 1 The objective of calibration is to provide traceability of measurement results obtained when using a calibrated measuring instrument or measuring system.
NOTE 2 The outcome of a calibration may be expressed by a statement, calibration function, calibration diagram, calibration curve, or calibration table. In some cases, it may consist of an additive or multiplicative correction of the indication with associated measurement uncertainty.
NOTE 3 Calibration should not be confused with adjustment of a measuring system, often mistakenly called “selfcalibration”, nor with verification of calibration. Calibration is sometimes a prerequisite for verification, which provides confirmation that specified requirements (often maximum permissible errors) are met. Calibration is sometimes also a prerequisite for adjustment, which is the set of operations carried out on a measuring system such that the system provides prescribed indications corresponding to given values of quantities being measured, typically obtained from
measurement standards.
NOTE 4 Sometimes the first step alone of the operation mentioned in the definition is intended as being calibration, as it was in previous editions of this Vocabulary. The second step is in fact required to establish instrumental uncertainty
for the measurement results obtained when using the calibrated measuring system. The two steps together aim to demonstrate the metrological traceability of measurement results obtained by a calibrated measuring system. In the
past the second step was usually considered to occur after the calibration.
NOTE 5 A comparison between two measurement standards may be viewed as a calibration if the comparison is used to check and, if necessary, correct the value and measurement uncertainty attributed to one of the measurement
standards.

NOTE 1 The quantity mentioned in the definition is an individual quantity.
NOTE 2 The relevant information mentioned in the definition may be about the values obtained by the measurement,
such that some may be more representative of the measurand than others.
NOTE 3 Measurement is sometimes considered to apply to nominal properties, but not in this Vocabulary, where the
process of obtaining values of nominal properties is called “examination”.
NOTE 4 Measurement requires both experimental comparison of quantities or experimental counting of entities at
some step of the process and the use of models and calculations that are based on conceptual considerations.
NOTE 5 The conditions of reasonable attribution mentioned in the definition take into account a description of the
quantity commensurate with the intended use of a measurement result, a measurement procedure, and a calibrated
measuring system operating according to the specified measurement procedure, including the measurement
conditions. Moreover, a maximum permissible error and/or a target uncertainty may be specified, and the
measurement procedure and the measuring system should then be chosen in order not to exceed these measuring
system specifications.

A pulse is applied before the mechani- cally enforced end of the drop and the current is sampled twice: just before the onset of the pulse and just before its end.

Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned. Additionally, the reference sample must be stable, of high purity, and must not experience much change across the temperature scan. Typically, reference standards have been metals such as indium, tin, bismuth, and lead, but other standards such as polyethylene and fatty acids have been proposed to study polymers and organic compounds, respectively."@en .

In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference are made to undergo identical thermal cycles, (i.e., same cooling or heating programme) while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference.[1] This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample."@en .

EBSD is carried out in a scanning electron microscope equipped with an EBSD detector comprising at least a phosphorescent screen, a compact lens and a low-light camera. In this configuration, the SEM incident beam hits the tilted sample. As backscattered electrons leave the sample, they interact with the crystal's periodic atomic lattice planes and diffract according to Bragg's law at various scattering angles before reaching the phosphor screen forming Kikuchi patterns (EBSPs). EBSD spatial resolution depends on many factors, including the nature of the material under study and the sample preparation. Thus, EBSPs can be indexed to provide information about the material's grain structure, grain orientation, and phase at the micro-scale. EBSD is applied for impurities and defect studies, plastic deformation, and statistical analysis for average misorientation, grain size, and crystallographic texture. EBSD can also be combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), cathodoluminescence (CL), and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) for advanced phase identification and materials discovery."@en .

the analysis of thin films. Through the analysis of the state of polarisation of the
light that is reflected from the sample, ellipsometry yields information on the layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the light itself, down to a single atomic
layer or less. Depending on what is already known about the sample, the technique
can probe a range of properties including layer thickness, morphology, and chemical composition."""@en .

Like other absorption spectroscopies, XAS techniques follow Beer's law. The X-ray absorption coefficient of a material as a function of energy is obtained by directing X-rays of a narrow energy range at a sample, while recording the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity, as the incident x-ray energy is incremented.
When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Every element has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons because of the high intensity of synchrotron X-ray sources allow the concentration of the absorbing element to reach as low as a few parts per million. Absorption would be undetectable if the source is too weak. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids."""@en .

Even though it is used extensively for military or security objectives, such as detecting drugs and explosives, the technology also has many applications in laboratory analysis, including studying small and big biomolecules. IMS instruments are extremely sensitive stand-alone devices, but are often coupled with mass spectrometry, gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography in order to achieve a multi-dimensional separation. They come in various sizes, ranging from a few millimeters to several meters depending on the specific application, and are capable of operating under a broad range of conditions. IMS instruments such as microscale high-field asymmetric-waveform ion mobility spectrometry can be palm-portable for use in a range of applications including volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring, biological sample analysis, medical diagnosis and food quality monitoring."@en .

Light scattering can be caused by factors such as the nature, texture, or specific structures of a surface and the presence of gas, liquid, or solid particles through which light propagates, as well as the nature of the light itself, of its wavelengths and polarization states. It usually results in diffuse light and can also affect the dispersion of color."@en .

This spectroscopy is based on the measurement of absorption of electromagnetic radiations in the radio frequency region from roughly 4 to 900 MHz. Absorption of radio waves in the presence of magnetic field is accompanied by a special type of nuclear transition, and for this reason, such type of spectroscopy is known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. The sample is placed in a magnetic field and the NMR signal is produced by excitation of the nuclei sample with radio waves into nuclear magnetic resonance, which is detected with sensitive radio receivers. The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups. As the fields are unique or highly characteristic to individual compounds, in modern organic chemistry practice, NMR spectroscopy is the definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds."@en .

Raman) is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified.

Raman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering of photons, known as Raman scattering. A source of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range is used, although X-rays can also be used. The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. The shift in energy gives information about the vibrational modes in the system. Infrared spectroscopy typically yields similar yet complementary information.

Typically, a sample is illuminated with a laser beam. Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the laser line (Rayleigh scattering) is filtered out by either a notch filter, edge pass filter, or a band pass filter, while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector."""@en .

Uniaxial tensile testing is the most commonly used for obtaining the mechanical characteristics of isotropic materials. Some materials use biaxial tensile testing.

An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a charge-coupled device."@en .

In most common UT applications, very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz, and occasionally up to 50 MHz, are transmitted into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials. A common example is ultrasonic thickness measurement, which tests the thickness of the test object, for example, to monitor pipework corrosion.

Ultrasonic testing is often performed on steel and other metals and alloys, though it can also be used on concrete, wood and composites, albeit with less resolution. It is used in many industries including steel and aluminium construction, metallurgy, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and other transportation sectors."""@en .

The ratio of the polymer solution flow time (t) to the flow time of pure solvent (t0) is equal to the ratio of their viscosities (η/η0) only if they have the same densities."@en .

It is a relatively simple technique where the sample is illuminated with X-rays which have enough energy to eject an electron from the atom.  These ejected electrons are known as photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of these emitted electrons is characteristic of the element from which the photoelectron originated. The position and intensity of the peaks in an energy spectrum provide the desired chemical state and quantitative information.  The surface sensitivity of XPS is determined by the distance that that photoelectron can travel through the material without losing any kinteic energy.  These elastiaclly scattered photoelectrons contribute to the photoelectron peak, whilst photoelectrons that have been inelastically scattered, losing some kinetic energy before leaving the material, will contribute to the spectral background."@en .

More than one numeral stands for the same number.
In the EMMO abstract entities do not exists, and numbers are simply defined by other numerals, so that a number is the class of all the numerals that are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 0011 are numerals that stands for the same number).
Or alternatively, an integer numeral may also stands for a set of a specific cardinality (e.g. 3 stands for a set of three apples). Rational and real numbers are simply a syntactic arrangment of integers (digits, in decimal system).
The fact that you can't give a name to a number without using a numeral or, in case of positive integers, without referring to a real world objects set with specific cardinality, suggests that the abstract concept of number is not a concept that can be practically used.
For these reasons, the EMMO will consider numerals and numbers as the same concept."""@en ;

This happens due to e.g. the complexity of the object, the lack of a underlying model for the representation of the object, the non-well specified meaning of the property symbols.

A 'SubjectiveProperty' cannot be used to univocally compare 'Object'-s.

e.g. you cannot evaluate the beauty of a person on objective basis."""@en ;

For this reason, the definition of every specific process subclass requires the introduction of a primitive concept."""@en ;

Following the two examples, a marathon individual is a maximal that can be decomposed into running intervals. The marathon class is a subclass of running."""@en .

Several concepts are labelled with this term, depending on the field of science. The concept mass is sometimes related to the term \"matter\", even if the former refers to a physical quantity (precisely defined by modern physics) while the latter is a type that qualifies a physical entity.
It is possible to identify more than one concept that can be reasonably labelled with the term \"matter\". For example, it is possible to label as matter only the entities that are made up of atoms. Or more generally, we can be more fine-grained and call \"matter\" the entities that are made up of protons, neutrons or electrons, so that we can call matter also a neutron radiation or a cathode ray.
A more fundamental approach, that we embrace for the EMMO, considers matter as entities that are made of fermions (i.e. quarks and leptons). This would exclude particles like the W and Z bosons that possess some mass, but are not fermions.
Antimatter is a subclass of matter."""@en ;

Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water.

The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of \"phase\" as a synonym for state of matter.

The EMMO relies on strong reductionism, i.e. everything real is a formless collection of elementary particles: we give a meaning to real world entities only by giving them boundaries and defining them using 'sign'-s.

In this way the 'sign'-ed entity becomes an 'object', and the 'object' is the basic entity needed in order to apply a logical formalism to the real world entities (i.e. we can speak of it through its sign, and use logics on it through its sign)."""@en ;

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.
In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.
To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental."""@en ;

In general the dimension of any quantity Q is written in the form of a dimensional product,

    dim Q = T^α L^β M^γ I^δ Θ^ε N^ζ J^η

where the exponents α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ and η, which are generally small integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero, are called the dimensional exponents.
-- SI brouchure

The SI dimensional units are equivalent to dimensional strings that uniquely defines their dimensionality by specifying the values of the coefficients α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ and η. A dimensional string is a space-separated string of the physical dimension symbols followed by the value of the exponent (including it sign). They should always match the following regular expression:

^T([+-][1-9]|0) L([+-][1-9]|0) M([+-][1-9]|0) I([+-][1-9]|0) Θ([+-][1-9]|0) N([+-][1-9]|0) J([+-][1-9]|0)$

Examples of correspondance between dimensional units and their dimensional units are:

- AmountOfSubstanceUnit <=> \"T0 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N+1 J0\"
- TimeUnit <=> \"T+1 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0\"
- ElectricCurrentDensityUnit <=> \"T0 L-2 M0 I+1 Θ0 N0 J0\""""@en .

One of the most general one applicable to causal systems is to ask that all the quantum parts of the system are bonded to the rest.
In other words, causal convexity excludes all quantums that leave the system (no more interacting), or that are not yet part of it (not yet interacting).
So, a photon leaving a body is not part of the body as convex system, while a photon the is carrier of electromagnetic interaction between two molecular parts of the body, is part of the convex body."""@en ;

The triadic elements:
- 'sign': the sign A (e.g. a name)
- 'interpretant': the sign B as the effects of the sign A on the interpreter (e.g. the mental concept of what a name means)
- 'object': the object C (e.g. the entity to which the sign A and B refer to)

Rather it embraces the fact that the physical dimensionality of a physical quantity is carried by its measurement unit. 

The role of dimensional unit and its subclasses is to express the physical dimensionality that is carried by the unit.

Since the dimensionality of a physical quantity can be written as the product of powers of the physical dimensions of the base quantities in the selected system of quantities, the physical dimensionality of a measurement unit is uniquely determined by the exponents. For a dimensional unit, at least one of these exponents must be non-zero (making it disjoint from dimensionless units)."""@en .

If I don't believe the vendor, then I can measure the actual thermal conductivity. I then perform a measurement process that semiotically assign another value for the conductivity, which is a measured property, since is part of a measurement process.

- object (focus on spatial configuration)
- process (focus on temporal evolution)

The concepts of endurant and perdurant implicitly rely on the concept of instantaneous 3D snapshot of the world object, that in the EMMO is not allowed since everything extends in 4D and there are no abstract objects. Moreover, time is a measured property in the EMMO and not an objective characteristic of an object, and cannot be used as temporal index to identify endurant position in time. 

For this reason an individual in the EMMO can always be classified both endurant and perdurant, due to its nature of 4D entity (e.g. an individual may belong both to the class of runners and the class of running process), and the distinction is purely semantic.  In fact, the object/process distinction is simply a matter of convenience in a 4D approach since a temporal extension is always the case, and stationarity depends upon observer time scale. For this reason, the same individual (4D object) may play the role of a process or of an object class depending on the object to which it relates.

Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce categorizations that characterize persistency through continuant and occurrent concepts, even if not ontologically but only cognitively defined. This is also due to the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist.

This perspective provides classes conceptually similar to the concepts of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). We claim that this distinction is motivated by our cognitive bias, and we do not commit to the fact that both these kinds of entity “do really exist”. For this reason, a whole instance can be both process and object, according to different cognitive approaches (see Wonderweb D17).

The distinction between endurant and perdurant as usually introduced in literature (see BFO SPAN/SNAP approach) is then no more ontological, but can still be expressed through the introduction of ad hoc primitive definitions that follow the interpreter endurantist or perdurantist attitude."""@en ;
