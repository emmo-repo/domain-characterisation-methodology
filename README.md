# Characterisation Methodology Domain Ontology (CHAMEO)
![CHAMEO logo](images/chameo_logo_large.png)
An ontology for materials characterization which represents the evolution of the [CHADA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235249281930087X?via%3Dihub) template in an ontological form, allowing to generate FAIR documentation of Characterisation Experiments and that has been used as a basis for the development of a number of technique-specific or application-specific ontologies in the materials characterisation domain.
CHAMEO has been used as a foundation for the definition of the new CHADA template during the [CWA](https://www.cencenelec.eu/media/CEN-CENELEC/CWAs/RI/2025/cwa17815_2025.pdf) .

This ontology development is supported by an [EMMC Task Group](https://emmc.eu/focus-areas/interoperability/tg2-5/). The corresponding forum can be found [here](https://emmc.eu/forum?view=topic&id=154).

## Requirements

The CHAMEO Ontology is built with an alignment with EMMO and some of its modules, as well as with EMMO-compliant domain-level ontologies developed for the Open Innovation Environment (OIE) from the OYSTER project. The following table describes the version compatibility between those ontologies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0             |


## Resources
- Squashed ontology (all imported ontologies included in the same turtle file for fast and robust loading): https://emmo-repo.github.io/domain-characterisation-methodology/chameo.ttl
- Pre-inferred ontology: https://emmo-repo.github.io/domain-characterisation-methodology/chameo-inferred.ttl
