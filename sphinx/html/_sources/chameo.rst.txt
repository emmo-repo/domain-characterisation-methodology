In a non-stirred solution, a diffusion-limited current is usually measured, which is propor-tional to the concentration of an electroactive analyte. The current is usually faradaic and the applied potential is usually constant. The integral of current with time is the electric charge, which may be related to the amount of substance reacted by Faraday’s laws of electrolysis. The amperometric method provides the ability to distinguish selectively between a number of electroactive species in solution by judicious selection of the applied potential and/or choice of electrode material.</td>

Since its early developments, Atom Probe Tomography has contributed to major advances in materials science. The sample is prepared in the form of a very sharp tip. The cooled tip is biased at high DC voltage (3-15 kV). The very small radius of the tip and the High Voltage induce a very high electrostatic field (tens V/nm) at the tip surface, just below the point of atom evaporation. Under laser or HV pulsing, one or more atoms are evaporated from the surface, by field effect (near 100% ionization), and projected onto a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) with a very high detection efficiency. Ion efficiencies are as high as 80%, the highest analytical efficiency of any 3D microscopy.</td>

NOTE 1 The objective of calibration is to provide traceability of measurement results obtained when using a calibrated measuring instrument or measuring system. NOTE 2 The outcome of a calibration may be expressed by a statement, calibration function, calibration diagram, calibration curve, or calibration table. In some cases, it may consist of an additive or multiplicative correction of the indication with associated measurement uncertainty. NOTE 3 Calibration should not be confused with adjustment of a measuring system, often mistakenly called “selfcalibration”, nor with verification of calibration. Calibration is sometimes a prerequisite for verification, which provides confirmation that specified requirements (often maximum permissible errors) are met. Calibration is sometimes also a prerequisite for adjustment, which is the set of operations carried out on a measuring system such that the system provides prescribed indications corresponding to given values of quantities being measured, typically obtained from measurement standards. NOTE 4 Sometimes the first step alone of the operation mentioned in the definition is intended as being calibration, as it was in previous editions of this Vocabulary.

In nanoindentation, the electrical signal coming from capacitive displacement gauge is converted into a real raw-displacement signal after using a proper calibration function (as obtained by the equipment manufacturer). Then, additional calibration procedures are applied to define the point of initial contact and to correct for instrument compliance, thermal drift, and indenter area function to obtain the real useable displacement data. Usually the calibration process involve a reference sample (with pre-defined, specific, and stable physical characteristics and known properties), in order to extract calibration data.

Coulometric titrations are usually carried out in convective mass transfer mode using a large surface working electrode. The reference and auxiliary electrodes are located in sepa- rate compartments. A basic requirement is a 100 % current efficiency of titrant generation at the working electrode. End-point detection can be accomplished with potentiometry, amperometry, biamperometry, bipotentiometry, photometry, or by using a visual indicator. The main advantages are that titration is possible with less stable titrants, the standardi- zation of titrant is not necessary, the volume of the test solution is not changed, and the method is easily automated.</td>

Normally the initial potential is chosen where no electrode reaction occurs and the switching potential is greater (more positive for an oxidation or more negative for a reduction) than the peak potential of the analyte reaction. The initial potential is usually the negative or positive limit of the cycle but can have any value between the two limits, as can the initial scan direction.

The current is sampled just before the onset of the pulse (e.g. 10 to 20 ms) and for the same sampling time just before the end of the pulse. The difference between the two sampled currents is plotted versus the potential applied before the pulse. Thus, a differential pulse voltammogram is peak-shaped. Differential pulse polarography is differential pulse voltammetry in which a dropping mercury electrode is used as the working electrode. A pulse is applied before the mechani- cally enforced end of the drop and the current is sampled twice: just before the onset of the pulse and just before its end. The pulse width is usually 10 to 20 % of the drop life. The drop dislodgement is synchronized with current sampling, which is carried out as in DPV. The ratio of faradaic current to charging current is enhanced and the negative influence of charging current is partially eliminated in the same way as in normal pulse voltammetry (NPV). Moreover, subtraction of the charging current sampled before the application of the pulse further decreases its negative influence. Due to the more enhanced signal (faradaic current) to noise (charging current) ratio, the limit of detection is lower than with NPV. The sensitivity of DPV depends on the reversibility of the electrode reaction of the analyte.</td>

Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned. Additionally, the reference sample must be stable, of high purity, and must not experience much change across the temperature scan. Typically, reference standards have been metals such as indium, tin, bismuth, and lead, but other standards such as polyethylene and fatty acids have been proposed to study polymers and organic compounds, respectively.</td>

Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation.

Impedimetric sensors are based on measurement of a concentration-dependent parameter taken from analysis of the respective electrochemical impedance spectra, or from the impedance magnitudes at a chosen fixed frequency. The sinusoidal current response lags behind the sinusoidal voltage perturbation by a phase angle φ. Resistances (e.g. to charge transfer) give a response in phase with the voltage perturbation; capacitances (e.g. double layer) give a response 90° out of phase; combinations of resistances and capacitances give phase angles between 0 and 90°. Plots of the out of phase vs. the in phase component of the impedance for all the frequencies tested are called complex plane (or Nyquist) plots. Plots of the phase angle and the magnitude of the impedance vs. the logarithm of perturbation frequency are called Bode diagrams. Complex plane plots are the more commonly used for electrochemical sensors.</td>

EBSD is carried out in a scanning electron microscope equipped with an EBSD detector comprising at least a phosphorescent screen, a compact lens and a low-light camera. In this configuration, the SEM incident beam hits the tilted sample. As backscattered electrons leave the sample, they interact with the crystal's periodic atomic lattice planes and diffract according to Bragg's law at various scattering angles before reaching the phosphor screen forming Kikuchi patterns (EBSPs). EBSD spatial resolution depends on many factors, including the nature of the material under study and the sample preparation. Thus, EBSPs can be indexed to provide information about the material's grain structure, grain orientation, and phase at the micro-scale. EBSD is applied for impurities and defect studies, plastic deformation, and statistical analysis for average misorientation, grain size, and crystallographic texture. EBSD can also be combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), cathodoluminescence (CL), and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) for advanced phase identification and materials discovery.</td>

      <td class="element-table-value">Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), along with X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), is a subset of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Like other absorption spectroscopies, XAS techniques follow Beer's law. The X-ray absorption coefficient of a material as a function of energy is obtained by directing X-rays of a narrow energy range at a sample, while recording the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity, as the incident x-ray energy is incremented. When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Every element has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons because of the high intensity of synchrotron X-ray sources allow the concentration of the absorbing element to reach as low as a few parts per million. Absorption would be undetectable if the source is too weak. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids.</td>

Most radioactive sources produce gamma rays, which are of various energies and intensities. When these emissions are detected and analyzed with a spectroscopy system, a gamma-ray energy spectrum can be produced. A detailed analysis of this spectrum is typically used to determine the identity and quantity of gamma emitters present in a gamma source, and is a vital tool in radiometric assay. The gamma spectrum is characteristic of the gamma-emitting nuclides contained in the source, just like in an optical spectrometer, the optical spectrum is characteristic of the material contained in a sample.</td>

A linear potential scan, at sufficiently slow scan rates so as to ensure a steady state response, is usually applied. Mass transport of a redox species enhanced by convection in this way results in a greater electric current. Convective mass transfer occurs up to the diffusion-limiting layer, within which the mass transfer is controlled by diffusion. Electroactive substance depletion outside the diffusion layer is annulled by convective mass transfer, which results in steady- state sigmoidal wave-shaped current-potential curves. The forced flow can be accomplished by movement either of the solution (solution stirring, or channel flow), or of the electrode (electrode rotation or vibration).</td>

IMS instruments are extremely sensitive stand-alone devices, but are often coupled with mass spectrometry, gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography in order to achieve a multi-dimensional separation. They come in various sizes, ranging from a few millimeters to several meters depending on the specific application, and are capable of operating under a broad range of conditions. IMS instruments such as microscale high-field asymmetric-waveform ion mobility spectrometry can be palm-portable for use in a range of applications including volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring, biological sample analysis, medical diagnosis and food quality monitoring.</td>

The pulse width is usually 10 to 20 % of the drop time. The drop dislodgment is synchro- nized with current sampling, which is carried out just before the end of the pulse, as in NPV. Sigmoidal wave-shaped voltammograms are obtained. The current is sampled at the end of the pulse and then plotted versus the potential of the pulse. The current is sampled just before the end of the pulse, when the charging current is greatly diminished. In this way, the ratio of faradaic current to charging current is enhanced and the negative influence of charging current is partially eliminated. Due to the improved signal (faradaic current) to noise (charging current) ratio, the limit of detec- tion is lowered. The sensitivity of NPV is not affected by the reversibility of the electrode reaction of the analyte.</td>

      <td class="element-table-value">Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, most commonly known as NMR spectroscopy or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), is a spectroscopic technique to observe local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei. This spectroscopy is based on the measurement of absorption of electromagnetic radiations in the radio frequency region from roughly 4 to 900 MHz. Absorption of radio waves in the presence of magnetic field is accompanied by a special type of nuclear transition, and for this reason, such type of spectroscopy is known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. The sample is placed in a magnetic field and the NMR signal is produced by excitation of the nuclei sample with radio waves into nuclear magnetic resonance, which is detected with sensitive radio receivers. The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups. As the fields are unique or highly characteristic to individual compounds, in modern organic chemistry practice, NMR spectroscopy is the definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds.</td>

      <td class="element-table-value">Two-step electrochemical measurement in which 1) material is accumulated at an electrode and 2) the material is removed by chemical reaction or electrochemically at constant current with measurement of electrode potential. Historically for the analysis of metal ions, mercury ions were added to the test solution to form a mercury amalgam when reduced. Alternatively, an HMDE or MFE was used and the oxidizing agent added after amalgam formation. However, the toxicity of mercury and its compounds have all but precluded the present-day use of mercury. The accumulation is similar to that used in stripping voltammetry. The stripping potentiogram shows staircase curves of potential as a function of time. Frequently, the first derivative is displayed (dE/dt=f(t)), as this produces peak-shaped signals. The time between transitions (peaks) is proportional to the concentration of analyte in the test solution. The time between changes in potential in step 2 is related to the concentration of analyte in the solution.</td>

Potentiometric methods are used to measure the electrochemical potentials of a metallic structure in a given environment. For measurements using ion-selective electrodes, the measurement is made under equilibrium conditions what means that the macroscopic electric current is zero and the concentrations of all species are uniform throughout the solution. The indicator electrode is in direct contact with the analyte solution, whereas the reference electrode is usually separated from the analyte solution by a salt bridge. The potential difference between the indicator and reference electrodes is normally directly proportional to the logarithm of the activity (concentration) of the analyte in the solution (Nernst equation).

      <td class="element-table-value">Raman spectroscopy (/ˈrɑːmən/) (named after physicist C. V. Raman) is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. Raman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering of photons, known as Raman scattering. A source of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range is used, although X-rays can also be used. The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. The shift in energy gives information about the vibrational modes in the system. Infrared spectroscopy typically yields similar yet complementary information. Typically, a sample is illuminated with a laser beam. Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the laser line (Rayleigh scattering) is filtered out by either a notch filter, edge pass filter, or a band pass filter, while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.</td>

This can give valuable information on the kinetics of the electrode reaction and the electrode process. The current is sampled just before the end of the forward- going pulse and of the backward-going pulse and the difference of the two sampled currents is plotted versus the applied potential of the potential or staircase ramp. The square-wave voltammogram is peak-shaped. The sensitivity of SWV depends on the reversibility of the electrode reaction of the analyte.</td>

      <td class="element-table-value">Two-step electrochemical measurement in which 1) material is accumulated at an electrode and 2) the amount of an accumulated species is measured by voltammetry. The measured electric current in step 2 is related to the concentration of analyte in the solution by calibration. Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) was historically used to measure concentrations of metal ions in solution using cathodic accumulation with mercury to form an amalgam. Due to the toxicity of mercury and its compounds, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry have frequently replaced ASV at mercury electrodes in the laboratory, often sacrificing the probing of speciation and lability in complex matrices. Mercury has now been replaced by non-toxic bismuth or anti- mony as films on a solid electrode support (such as glassy carbon) with equally good sensi- tivity and detection limits. Because the accumulation (pre-concentration) step can be prolonged, increasing the amount of material at the electrode, stripping voltammetry is able to measure very small concentrations of analyte. Often the product of the electrochemical stripping is identical to the analyte before the accumulation. Stripping voltammetry is a calibrated method to establish the relation between amount accumulated in a given time and the concentration of the analyte in solution. Types of stripping voltammetry refer to the kind of accumulation (e.g. adsorptive stripping voltammetry) or the polarity of the stripping electrochemistry (anodic, cathodic stripping voltammetry).</td>

A common example is ultrasonic thickness measurement, which tests the thickness of the test object, for example, to monitor pipework corrosion. Ultrasonic testing is often performed on steel and other metals and alloys, though it can also be used on concrete, wood and composites, albeit with less resolution. It is used in many industries including steel and aluminium construction, metallurgy, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and other transportation sectors.</td>

The kinetic energy of these emitted electrons is characteristic of the element from which the photoelectron originated. The position and intensity of the peaks in an energy spectrum provide the desired chemical state and quantitative information. The surface sensitivity of XPS is determined by the distance that that photoelectron can travel through the material without losing any kinteic energy. These elastiaclly scattered photoelectrons contribute to the photoelectron peak, whilst photoelectrons that have been inelastically scattered, losing some kinetic energy before leaving the material, will contribute to the spectral background.</td>
